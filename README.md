# GoTGit

**GoTGit:** A simple recreation of Git written in Go that I started as an exercise. It implements some of Git's low-level ("plumbing") commands. It was started as a [CodeCrafters](https://codecrafters.io/) challenge but has taken on a life of its own. 

*Go (written in Go) + T (my first initial) + Git*  &nbsp;&#128512;
